        To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic that explores themes of racial injustice, morality, and human compassion. Published in 1960, the novel is set in the racially segregated town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression. Through the eyes of Scout Finch, a young girl, Harper Lee crafts a poignant narrative that remains relevant even today.

        The story follows Scout, her brother Jem, and their father, Atticus Finch, a principled lawyer who defends Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of assaulting a white woman. Through Scoutâ€™s innocent yet insightful perspective, the novel highlights the deep-seated prejudices in society and the courage it takes to stand up for justice.
